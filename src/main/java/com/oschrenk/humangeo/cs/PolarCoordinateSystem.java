/**
 * The polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which
 * each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a fixed point and an
 * angle from a fixed direction.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The fixed point (analogous to the origin of a Cartesian system) is called the
 * pole, and the ray from the pole in the fixed direction is the polar axis. The
 * distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or <i>radius</i>, and
 * the angle is the angular coordinate, <i>polar angle</i>, or azimuth.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The radial coordinate is denoted by r, and the angular coordinate by Î¸
 * (theta). Angles in polar notation are expressed in degrees.
